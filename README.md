Project description: 
	We are looking to normalize benchmark accounting data for small business owners. Through our app, small business owners around the United States will be able to share anonymous information, such as balance sheets, income statements, expense reports, etc. Through integrations with other services such as PayPal Marketing Solutions, Quickbooks, Shopify, Google Analytics, and Salesforce, we are able to combine industry information to help new business owners make profitable decisions.
